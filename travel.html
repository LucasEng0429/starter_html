          <h3>Geographical Location: Asia</h3>
          <p>
            Shanghai, a vibrant metropolis, is nestled along the eastern coast of
            China. With a population of over 26 million, it ranks as one of the
            world's most populous cities and serves as a global financial hub. The
            cityscape of Shanghai is an exquisite blend of history and modernity,
            where towering skyscrapers such as the iconic Oriental Pearl Tower and
            the Shanghai Tower punctuate the skyline alongside historical
            landmarks like the Bund, a waterfront promenade that showcases
            colonial-era architecture.
          </p>
          <p>
            The city has an unparalleled shoppign scene that caters to all tastes,
            from luxury brands in shiny malls to hidden gems in busy markets.
            Moreover, Shanghai's culinary landscape is a testament to its
            multiculturalism, offering a symphony of flavors that range from
            traditional street food like xiaolongbao (soup dumplings) to
            avant-garde dining experiences.

          <h3>Geographical Location: North America</h3>
          <p>Yellowstone is the first national park in the United States. It covers over 2.2 million acres, and provides an opportunity to see wildlife and explore geothermal areas.  In fact, Yellowstone contains about half the world's active geysers.</p>
          <p>These unique opportunities also bring out a lot of bad decisions among the tourists.  Every year visitors injure themselves or the wildlife by getting close to the animals.  You  can see examples of people making bad decisions by visiting <a href ="https://www.facebook.com/groups/yellowstonenationalparkinvasionoftheidiots/">Yellowstone National Park: Invasion of the Idiots</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/touronsofyellowstone/?hl=en">Tourons of Yellowstone</a>, or  <a href="https://cowboystatedaily.com/">Cowboy State Daily</a>.</p>

        <h2>Rome, Italy</h2>

        <h3>Geographical Location: Europe</h3>
        <p>The national capital of Italy remains a historical and political hub today. Nicknamed the “Eternal City,” Rome is considered the origination of the Catholic Church and Roman civilization central to the development of the Western World. Divided into 22 walled rioni (districts) surrounded by 35 quartieri urbani (urban sectors) that are surrounded by 6 large suburbi (suburbs), the city, just larger than New York City at an area of 496 square miles, is home to 2.8 million residents. Its economy runs on the tourism and services industries, the latter mostly in government jobs.</p>
        <p>The Via del Corso, named after Roman carnival horse races, is the main street that runs through Rome. Many significant churches, palaces, and squares run along this road (Piazza del Popolo, and the Spanish Steps in Piazza di Spagna, for example). The seven hills that surround Rome are trenched with mythological history which can be seen through the prevalence of temples. Must see landmarks for those traveling include the Colosseum, Roman Forum, Pantheon, and Catacombs. St. Peter’s Square & Basilica and the Sistine Chapel, technically located within Vatican City – an independent city-state within Rome – are also worth a visit.</p>

      <h3>Geographical Location: North America</h3>
      <p>Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore, America’s first National Lakeshore, is along the southern shore of Lake Superior in Michigan’s beautiful Upper Peninsula. With stunning beaches, 10 inland lakes, and nearly 100 miles of trails, everyone can find something to enjoy at Pictured Rocks! (source: https://www.nps.gov/piro/planyourvisit/index.htm)</p>
      <p>No matter the time of year, there is something to do at Pictured Rocks! Summer: visit beaches, backpack, and camp (permit required). Looking for views of the cliffs? The best way to see the cliffs is from the water on a commercial boat tour. Fall: Autumn colors in the Upper Peninsula are often breathtaking, drive the park roads to view the changing leaves! Hunting and fishing opportunities (state regulations apply) abound during fall! Winter: Cold weather brings otherworldly frozen waterfalls, called “curtains”. Snowshoeing, skiing, and ice fishing are other popular winter activities. Check road closures and conditions before heading into the park in the winter. Spring: Go birding or walk the marsh trail! (source: https://www.nps.gov/piro/planyourvisit/index.htm)</p>
